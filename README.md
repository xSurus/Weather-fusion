# Weather-fusion
We fuse weather (yes, really)

If all things are going according to plan, the website should be live at [weather.flatmasters.ch](https://weather.flatmasters.ch). 
The website is expected to be online during January of 2024.

## Information for TA's:
There were some more changes to deploy the project to digital ocean on Jan 2 2024. Logging (because we want to know if 
something is breaking) and some shell scripts were added. We also needed to restart the server on Jan 5 2023 because we 
ran out of storage space. So there are some changes in there that we needed to debug and we cleared the database for 
good measure. 

The master branch should only contain the changes that were made up to Dec 20 2023. All changes I (Alexander Sotoudeh) 
made to deploy and debug the project are in the branch `backend` and `production`.

I've also added the tag `final-project-state` for your convenience since I may add more information to the README.md if the need arises.

Thank you for your time.
